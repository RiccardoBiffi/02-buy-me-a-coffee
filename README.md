# **Week #2 of Alchemy's Road to Web3**

**Buy Me A Coffee** is a popular website that creators, educators, entertainers, and all kinds of people use to create a landing page where anyone can send some amount of money as a thank you for their services. However, in order to use it, you must have a bank account and a credit card. Not everyone has that!

A benefit of decentralized applications built on top of a blockchain is that anyone from around the world can access the app using just an Ethereum wallet, which anyone can set up for free in under 1 minute.

In this project I will develop and deploy a decentralized "Buy Me a Coffee" smart contract that allows visitors to send (fake) ETH as tips and leave messages.
